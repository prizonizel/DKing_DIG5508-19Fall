Lab 2 Notes

Hi Dr. Murray,

I struggled with the Gutenberg part, but I did much better in the Pixels and Pictures part. Here's a summary of what I accomplished:

Gutenberg

2-1: I loaded in the text for Huckleberry Finn

2-2: UPDATED -- I used the tuples_and_sorting tutorial, and I think I have this working.

2-3: I don't know how to do this one, because the code for getting word counts only returns a list of word with the number 1 next to them.

Pixels and Pictures

2-4: The code works! I wrote the function to accept an x value rather than a y value so the user can set x position where the vertical line should be drawn. Is that what you intended?

2-5: The code works!

2-6: This one is working too!

2-7: This function works!

2-8: I got the batch functionality to work, but I did not see in the book how to append text to the filenames when saving over them.
