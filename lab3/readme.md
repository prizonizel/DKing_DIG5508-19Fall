I have modified carProcessingPy.pyde to do the following:

-When the 1 or 2 key is pressed, the color of the corresponding car is randomly changed.

-Five trees of varying heights are generated.

-The user can click to paint a road tile onto the background. By pressing C, they can switch to a version of the brush with a crosswalk on it, and they can press R to switch back again.
