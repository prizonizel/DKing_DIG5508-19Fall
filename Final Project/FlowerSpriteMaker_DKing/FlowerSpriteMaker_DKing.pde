/*
Daniel King's DIG5508 Final Project

In my game Field of Cures,
flower objects are displayed with three sprites layered on top of each other:
-one layer of petals,
-another layer of petals out of phase with the first,
-and the center of the flower, where the pollen is.

The number of petals ranges from 6 to 16
(3 to 8 in each layer of petals).

I drew these layers by hand to make placeholder graphics,
but now I want to procedurally generate graphics that look better.

The output will be 18 image files:
3 layers for 6 types of flowers.

The GOAL is to make my flowers look GOOD!

In order to do this, I will first have to sketch each flower in Processing.

When I am happy with each design, I will then save the generative code
into a program that will save out each layer of each design.
