Daniel King's DIG5508 Final Project

In my game Field of Cures, flower objects are displayed with three sprites layered on top of each other:
-one layer of petals,
-another layer of petals out of phase with the first,
-and the center of the flower, where the pollen is.

The number of petals ranges from 6 to 16 (3 to 8 in each layer of petals).

I drew these layers by hand to make placeholder graphics, but now I have procedurally generated graphics that look better.

The output of my program is 13 image files: 2 layers for 6 types of flowers, plus one file for the center of the flowers.
